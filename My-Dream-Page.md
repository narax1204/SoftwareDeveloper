<p>Hello everyone, I am a college student. I have always been interested in digital technologies and coding. After finishing my High School, I was very excited to enter to college and explore in the field of Computer Science. It was my dream to do a live coding when the computer is in front of me and I will be solving various problems with the use of my own skills of coding.</p>
